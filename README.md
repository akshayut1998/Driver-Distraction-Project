# Distracted Driver Detection using Dashboard Cameras

## Overview
This project aims to address the critical issue of distracted driving by leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning models. The challenge, presented by State Farm on Kaggle, involves classifying driver behaviors based on a dataset of 2D dashboard camera images. The goal is to automatically detect distracted behaviors such as texting, talking on the phone, operating the radio, and more.

## Problem Statement
Distracted driving is a leading cause of car accidents, accounting for one in five incidents according to the CDC motor vehicle safety division. The consequences are severe, with 425,000 injuries and 3,000 fatalities annually. State Farm seeks to improve these alarming statistics and enhance customer safety and insurance by exploring the potential of dashboard cameras in identifying distracted driving behaviors.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises 2D dashboard camera images labeled with ten different classes, representing various driving behaviors. These classes include normal driving, texting, talking on the phone, operating the radio, drinking, and more.

## Approach
The project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning, leveraging pre-trained models to enhance the efficiency of feature extraction. Transfer learning allows the model to benefit from knowledge gained on a different but related task, improving performance on the specific problem of distracted driver detection.

## Evaluation
The performance of the models were evaluated using accuracy on an unseen dataset.

## Instructions
